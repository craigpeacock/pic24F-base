# pic24F-base
Example (base) source code for the Beyondlogic PIC24FJ256GB106 Development Board:
https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/Craig-Peacock-4/PIC32-PIC24-dsPIC-Development-Board

This code provides basic I/O definitions, config bits, UART and timer functions and can provide a foundation for developing more custom applications.

Upon execution, the code will display "Hello World" on UART1 and 9,600bps, toggle LED1 (RE0) @ 100mS and toggle LED2 on receipt of a character on UART1.
